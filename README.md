# Anomaly-detection
Anomaly detection using Tensorflow, and Keras

Note: You need to extract features before perfoming this training. You can use C3D to extract the features.

Use this link to extract C3D features from DataSet.

Data-set - https://www.dropbox.com/sh/75v5ehq4cdg5g5g/AABvnJSwZI7zXb8_myBA0CLHa?dl=0 

The above project is perfomed in Google Colaboratory. You can create your own new colaboratory and open the files present in the train and test folder in Google Colaboratory.
